% Description: 
%   Generic function to perform PCA and plot results
%
% Input:  
%       data_matrix - matrix of data; rows are items and columns are dimensions
%       categories - string matrix containing name of indices
%       names - string matrix of names/items
%

% Example usage:
% load cities
% data_matrix = ratings;

% Plot of two principal components and categories
